# KiTECH Ribbon & Nametag Font Customizer

This project provides an intuitive web-based tool designed for testing and selecting fonts to print on **nametags**, **ribbons**, or other customizable surfaces. By previewing different fonts and layouts in real-time, you can easily identify the best typography for your designs before printing.
